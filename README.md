# Soup
 This is just a silly piece of software for counting how many cans of aplabet soup would be needed to write out entire books.
 I started this because I saw a fellow on tiktok who did this in C++. He briefly shows his code in the video, and it looked like a pretty massive project.
 I thought, "Well I could probably write that in a few minutes in python, and sure enough I could! I mean it runs substancially slower and uses way more resources than it needs to, but I would rather make a computer do the work.
